/** Instruction:
 *    This is a boiler plate, or a "starting point" for React Router.
 *    This boiler plate uses React Router 5.3. You MUST read and use the documentation
 *       for React Router 5.3 if you decide to use this boiler plate.
 *
 *    You are not required to use RR 5.3 for your final.
 *    You may use this boiler plate for your final if you want to.

/*------------------------ Creating a New Route ------------------------*/

/**
 * Step 1: npm install to install your node_modules folder
 * Step 2: npm start inside this project directory to see how the boiler plate is already set up.
 * Step 3: Rename: the Home and About components & routes to something you want
 *         to use for your final.
 * Step 4: Connect a third component so your nav now goes to three places instead
 *         of just two.
 *
 *         Make sure for this new component you have done the following:
 *           - Create a new <li></li> element in your nav component.
 *           - Put a <Link> component in that element with a name, and a to attribute.
 *           - Create a new <Route> component inside of your <Switch> component.
 *               It should sit on the upper level of the other two <Route> components.
 *               Make sure the syntax is the same as the other two components.
 *           - Test to make sure that all three components navigate correctly.
